# simple-pomodoro-project

## Project description
This is a little improvement of pomodoro app from a tutorial here: https://freshman.tech/pomodoro-timer/. At this project, I remade the JS side using class and add some liitle feature like adding the task name, customize duration and reset button. Btw, I will update some other important features later (i.e. history of completed pomodoros that stored to local browser, etc.) and fix some annoying bugs.

## Technology used
Just a simple vanilla JS page (absolutely with HTML and CSS too)

## How to run
Just click this page : https://firsty-rahma.github.io/simple-pomodoro-project/ (this is the black and white site).

Thanks for reading
